The documentation is vast, fragmented across many pages, and often requires specific search skills to get the right answer quickly.\n\n### Solution:\nThis project leverages Generative AI + Web Search Integration to simplify AWS troubleshooting. Just type a natural language question like \"How to create an EC2 instance?\", and the assistant will:\n  - Search AWS docs using SerpAPI + Google\n  - Extract structured, step-by-step content\n  - Format and present a concise, human-readable guide\n\n*Example*\n  - Quick AWS Setup Guides (e.g., \"How to create an S3 bucket\")\n  - Troubleshooting Help (e.g., \"Fix Lambda timeout errors\")\n  - Learning AWS Services (e.g., \"RDS backup best practices\")\n\n### Features\n1. Prioritizes documentation (docs.aws.amazon.com) from AWS\n2. Parses headings, steps, and code blocks\n3. Removes AWS doc artifacts\n4. Uses general web results if AWS docs are unavailable\n5. Interactive CLI\n\n\n### Notebook Structure\n1. Install dependencies and API keys\n2. **Search** : seach_aws_docs() finds relevant AWS pages\n3. **Extract** : extract_service_guide() scrapes headings/steps\n4. **Format** : format_aws_summary() structures the output\n5. **Interactive CLI** : aws_service_assistant() handles query\n\n\n### GenAI Capabilities\n1. **Document Understanding** in extracting structures information from documentation.\n2. **Structured Output/Controlled Generation** formatted the extracted content into the standardized template.\n3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to dynamically retrieve AWS docs to generate accurate responses.\n4. **Function Calling** from main assistant function to other functions based on user input\n5. **Grounding** the outputs in official AWS docs.\n6. **Long Context Window** as large HTML documents are processed but truncates to 1000 character for relevance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.

To help you decide which service best meets your\n  needs, see Choosing an AWS storage service . For general information, see Cloud Storage on AWS .\n\nAWS Backup:\n- AWS Backup enables you to centralize and automate\n   data protection across AWS services. AWS Backup offers a cost-effective, fully managed, policy-based\n   service that further simplifies data protection at scale. AWS Backup also helps you support your\n   regulatory compliance or business policies for data protection. Together with AWS Organizations, AWS Backup\n   enables you to centrally deploy data protection policies to configure, manage, and govern your\n   backup activity across your organizationâs AWS accounts and resources, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n   (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) databases (including Amazon Aurora\n   clusters), Amazon DynamoDB tables, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems,\n   Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems, and AWS Storage Gateway volumes.\n\nAmazon Elastic Block Store:\n- Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block storage\n   volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically\n   replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high\n   availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer the consistent and low-latency performance\n   needed to run your workloads. With Amazon EBS, you can scale your usage up or down within minutes--all\n   while paying a low price for only what you provision.\n\nAWS Elastic Disaster Recovery:\n- AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (Elastic Disaster Recovery) minimizes downtime and\n   data loss with fast, reliable recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications using\n   affordable storage, minimal compute, and point-in-time recovery. You can configure replication\n   and launch settings, monitor data replication, and launch instances for drills or recovery.\n- Set up Elastic Disaster Recovery on your source servers to initiate secure data replication. Your data is\n   replicated to a staging area subnet in your AWS account, in the AWS Region that you select.\n   You can perform non-disruptive tests to confirm that implementation is complete. During normal\n   operation, maintain readiness by monitoring replication and periodically performing\n   non-disruptive recovery and failback drills.\n- If you must replicate to the AWS China Regions or perform replication and recovery into\n   AWS Outposts, use CloudEndure Disaster Recovery available in the AWS Marketplace.\n\nAmazon Elastic File System:\n- Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, elastic\n     \n ================================================== \n # Check the links provided above for more details\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"\nWhat AWS service do you need help with?

For information about the permissions necessary to\n          work with roles, see Permissions required for using roles\n        with Amazon EC2 . For information about adding\n          permissions to a user, see Manage IAM policies .\n- If you cannot modify your own permissions, you must contact an administrator who can\n          work with IAM in order to update your permissions.\n- If you created a role using the IAM CLI or API, verify the following:\n- You created an instance profile and added the role to that instance\n              profile.\n- You used the same name for the role and the instance profile. If you name your\n              role and instance profile differently, you won't see the correct role name in the\n              Amazon EC2 console.\n- The IAM Role list in the Amazon EC2 console lists the names of\n          instance profiles, not the names of roles. You will have to select the name of the\n          instance profile that contains the role you want. For details about instance profiles, see Use instance profiles .\n- If you use the IAM console to create roles, you don't need to work with instance\n            profiles. For each role that you create in the IAM console, an instance profile is\n            created with the same name as the role, and the role is automatically added to that\n            instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one IAM role, and that limit\n            cannot be increased.\n\nThe credentials on my instance are for the\n        wrong role:\n- The role in the instance profile might have been replaced recently. If so, your\n      application will need to wait for the next automatically scheduled credential rotation before\n      credentials for your role become available.\n- To force the change, you must disassociate the instance\n        profile and then associate the instance profile , or you can stop your instance and then restart\n      it.\n\nWhen I attempt to call the\n          AddRoleToInstanceProfile, I get an AccessDenied error:\n- If you are making requests as an IAM user, verify that you have the following\n      permissions:\n- iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile with the resource matching the instance\n          profile ARN (for example, arn:aws:iam::9  \n ================================================== \n # Check the links provided above for more details\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"\nWhat AWS service do you need help with?  how to setup content delivery network\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nSearching AWS documentation for: how to setup content delivery network\nFound 3 relevant resources.
