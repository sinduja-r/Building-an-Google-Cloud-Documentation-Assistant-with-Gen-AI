Given any Google Cloud service query, the assistant intelligently retrieves relevant pages, extracts structured content, and summarizes it in a clear, human-readable format.\n\n\n### Use Case:\nGoogle Cloud documentation is rich but often complex, scattered across multiple pages, and time-consuming to navigate—especially when troubleshooting. \n\n### Solution:\nThis assistant removes that friction by combining Generative AI with real-time search to deliver precise, structured guidance. This project leverages Generative AI + Web Search Integration to simplify troubleshooting. Just type a natural language question like \"How to create a compute engine instance?\", and receive:\n  - A step-by-step summary of official documentation\n  - Key IAM permissions, CLI/API commands, and console instructions\n  - Clean, deduplicated links to additional resources\n\n*Example Queries*\n  - Quick Google Cloud Setup Guides (e.g., \"Cloud Storage bucket creation\")\n  - Troubleshooting Help (e.g., \"RDBMS timeout errors\")\n  - Learning new Services (e.g., \"IAM role best practices\")\n\n### Features\n1. Prioritizes documentation (cloud.google.com/docs)\n2. Extracts steps, code snippets, CLI commands, IAM roles, and console instructions\n3. Removes noise and irrelevant page elements\n4. Falls back to generic guides if detailed parsing fails\n5. Interactive terminal-based CLI experience\n\n\n### Notebook Structure\n1. Install dependencies and API keys\n2. **Search** : search_cloud_docs() to locate relevant Google Cloud documentation\n3. **Extract** : extract_cloud_content() parses HTML to extract structured sections\n4. **Format** : format_cloud_summary() creates a summarized guide\n5. **Interactive CLI** : cloud_service_assistant() handles user queries\n\n\n### GenAI Capabilities\n1. **Document Understanding**: Extracts meaningful sections, commands, and steps from HTML pages.\n2. **Structured Output**: Summarizes documentation in standardized sections (e.g., IAM, CLI, API, Console)\n3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Dynamically fetches content grounded in real-time Google Cloud documentation.\n4. **Function Calling**: Modular assistant calls different functions based on user input\n5. **Grounding**: Limits search to official Google Cloud documentation (cloud.google.com)\n6. **Long-Context Handling**: Parses full pages but truncates responses for readability (2000-character summaries)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.

You can't create\nlog-based metrics for other Google Cloud resources such as\nCloud Billing accounts or organizations.\n• For information about the differences between project-based log-based metrics\nand bucket-based log-based metrics, see Bucket-scoped log-based metrics .\n• Logging provides a set of metrics for usage values such as the\nnumber of log entries stored in log buckets in your project, or\nthe number of bytes you've exported.\nFor a complete list of system-defined metrics, see Google Cloud metrics: logging .\n• You can create user-defined log-based metrics to\ntrack other metrics that are important for your project. For\nexample, you might create a log-based metric to count the number of log\nentries that match a given filter.\n• By default, user-defined log-based metrics are calculated from all logs\nreceived by the Logging API for the Google Cloud project,\nregardless of any inclusion filters or exclusion filters that might apply to the\nGoogle Cloud project.\n• You can also create user-defined log-based metrics\nfor a specific log bucket in a Google Cloud project. Bucket-scoped\nlog-based metrics are calculated from all logs destined for the bucket,\nregardless of where they originated. For more information see Log-based metrics on log buckets .\n• Log-based metrics can extract data from logs to create metrics of the\nfollowing types:\n  - Counter: these metrics count the number of log entries that match a\nspecified filter within a specific period. Use counters when you want to keep\ntrack of the number of times a value or string appears in your logs.\n  - Distribution: these metrics also count values, but they collect the\ncounts into ranges of values ( hist\n============================================================\nFull documentation: https://cloud.google.com/log-based-metric\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"\nWhat Google Cloud service do you need help with?  troubleshoot Network loadbalancer\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nSearching Google Cloud docs for: troubleshoot network loadbalancer\nReviewing: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/troubleshooting-ilb\nReviewing: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/network/troubleshooting-networklb\n\nGOOGLE CLOUD TROUBLESHOOT NETWORK LOADBALANCER GUIDE\n============================================================\n## Troubleshoot common issues with Network Analyzer\n• Network Analyzer automatically monitors your VPC network configuration and detects\nboth suboptimal configurations and misconfigurations.
