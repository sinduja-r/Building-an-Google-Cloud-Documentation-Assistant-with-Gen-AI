GOOGLE CLOUD LOG BASED METRIC GUIDE
============================================================
## Sources of log-based metrics
• You can use the metrics defined by Cloud Logging to collect general usage
information, and you can define your own log-based metric to capture information
specific to your application or business.
• Log-based metrics can apply within a single Google Cloud project or within a log
bucket. You can't create
log-based metrics for other Google Cloud resources such as
Cloud Billing accounts or organizations.
• For information about the differences between project-based log-based metrics
and bucket-based log-based metrics, see Bucket-scoped log-based metrics .
• Logging provides a set of metrics for usage values such as the
number of log entries stored in log buckets in your project, or
the number of bytes you've exported.
For a complete list of system-defined metrics, see Google Cloud metrics: logging .
• You can create user-defined log-based metrics to
track other metrics that are important for your project. For
example, you might create a log-based metric to count the number of log
entries that match a given filter.
• By default, user-defined log-based metrics are calculated from all logs
received by the Logging API for the Google Cloud project,
regardless of any inclusion filters or exclusion filters that might apply to the
Google Cloud project.
• You can also create user-defined log-based metrics
for a specific log bucket in a Google Cloud project. Bucket-scoped
log-based metrics are calculated from all logs destined for the bucket,
regardless of where they originated. For more information see Log-based metrics on log buckets .
• Log-based metrics can extract data from logs to create metrics of the
following types:
  - Counter: these metrics count the number of log entries that match a
specified filter within a specific period. Use counters when you want to keep
track of the number of times a value or string appears in your logs.
  - Distribution: these metrics also count values, but they collect the
counts into ranges of values ( hist
