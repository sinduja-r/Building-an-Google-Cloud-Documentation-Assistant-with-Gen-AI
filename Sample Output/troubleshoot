 AWS TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS FOR IAM PERMISSION ISSUE IN EC2 INSTANCE GUIDE 
 ========================================================================
            
Troubleshoot IAM and Amazon EC2:
- The following information can help you troubleshoot IAM issues with Amazon EC2.
- When I try to launch an instance, I don't
        see the role in the Amazon EC2 console IAM Role list
- When I attempt to call the
          AddRoleToInstanceProfile, I get an AccessDenied error
- Amazon EC2: When I try to launch an
        instance with a role, I get an AccessDenied error
- I can't access the temporary security
        credentials on my EC2 instance
- What do the errors from the
          info document in the IAM subtree mean?

When I try to launch an instance, I don't
        see the role in the Amazon EC2 console IAM Role list:
- If you are signed in as an IAM user, verify that you have permission to call ListInstanceProfiles . For information about the permissions necessary to work with roles, see Permissions required for using roles
        with Amazon EC2 . For information about adding permissions to a user, see Manage IAM policies .
- If you cannot modify your own permissions, you must contact an administrator who can work with IAM in order to update your permissions.
- If you created a role using the IAM CLI or API, verify the following:
- You created an instance profile and added the role to that instance profile.
- You used the same name for the role and the instance profile. If you name your role and instance profile differently, you won't see the correct role name in the Amazon EC2 console.
- The IAM Role list in the Amazon EC2 console lists the names of instance profiles, not the names of roles. You will have to select the name of the instance profile that contains the role you want. For details about instance profiles, see Use instance profiles.
- If you use the IAM console to create roles, you don't need to work with instance profiles. For each role that you create in the IAM console, an instance profile is created with the same name as the role, and the role is automatically added to that instance profile. An instance profile can contain only one IAM role, and that limit cannot be increased.

The credentials on my instance are for the wrong role:
- The role in the instance profile might have been replaced recently. If so, your application will need to wait for the next automatically scheduled credential rotation before credentials for your role become available.
- To force the change, you must disassociate the instance profile and then associate the instance profile , or you can stop your instance and then restart it.

When I attempt to call the
          AddRoleToInstanceProfile, I get an AccessDenied error:
- If you are making requests as an IAM user, verify that you have the following permissions:
- iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile with the resource matching the instance
          profile ARN (for example, arn:aws:iam::9
