============================================================
## Troubleshoot common issues with Network Analyzer
• Network Analyzer automatically monitors your VPC network configuration and detects
both suboptimal configurations and misconfigurations. It identifies network
failures, provides root cause information, and suggests possible resolutions. To
learn about the different misconfiguration scenarios that are automatically
detected by Network Analyzer, see Load balancer insights in the Network Analyzer documentation. Network Analyzer is available in the Google Cloud console as a part of
Network Intelligence Center. Go to Network Analyzer
• When creating a load balancer, you might see the error:
• This happens when you try to use the same backend in two different load
balancers, and the backends don't have compatible balancing modes.
• For more information, see the following:
  - Restrictions and guidance for instance
groups
  - Change the balancing mode of a load
balancer
• If you can't connect to your internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, check for the following common
issues.
  - Ensure that ingress allow firewall
rules are defined to
permit health checks to backend VMs.
  - Ensure that ingress allow firewall rules allow traffic
to the backend VMs from clients.
  - Ensure that relevant firewall rules exist to allow traffic to reach the
backend VMs on the ports being used by the load balancer.
  - If you're using target tags for the firewall
rules , make
sure that the load balancer's backend VMs are tagged appropriately.
• To learn how to configure firewall rules required by your internal passthrough Network Load Balancer,
see Configuring firewall
rules .
• If you can connect to a healthy backend VM, but cannot connect to the load
balancer, it might be that the Guest environment (formerly, the Windows Guest Environment or Linux Guest Environment)
on the VM is either not running or is unable to communicate with the metadata
server ( metadata.google.internal , 169.254.169.254 ).
